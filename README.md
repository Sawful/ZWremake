## Project Overview

**Originally developed on Unity**, we made the decision to **transition to Godot** due to concerns surrounding changes in Unity's terms of service. This shift required significant effort, particularly for an amateur programmer like myself, involving adjustments to various systems. Now that the transition is complete, my focus is on implementing and addressing any outstanding tasks.

It's important to note that **this is my inaugural game project**, and I am learning and evolving throughout the process. **Your understanding and patience are greatly appreciated.**
## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will the project be finished?

As this project is pursued as a hobby and a learning experience, **there is no set completion date**. However, I am committed to regular work on it and aim to make consistent progress.

### What's up with the name?

At present, the project draws inspiration from Zombie World, but **an official name has not been finalized**. I plan to determine a fitting name as the project evolves.

### What makes this game "Active"?

The term "active" in the context of this wave survival game indicates **that players are actively engaged in moving around the map**. They can **intensify the gameplay** by activating specific zones, thereby **increasing the challenge and earning more substantial rewards**. Unlike traditional difficulty settings chosen at the start, **players can dynamically raise the difficulty during the 30 minutes of wave survival**. The inclusion of a talent tree promotes intrinsic progression, allowing players to experiment with new builds and **push their limits with each playthrough**.

### How much replayability will the game offer?

Upon release, the game will feature **three distinct classes**, offering diverse player experiences. Progression within each class tree requires **achieving various accomplishments**, ensuring that each game presents **unique challenges and objectives**.
Although we want people to enjoy our game for more than 20 minutes, **we strive for quality before quantity**.
